You are sitting on a tree branch in an open field, listening to you sister
read a history book. You are very bored, when you suddenly notice a talking
white rabbit with a pocket watch currying along the river bank. He quickly
goes down a dark rabbit hole.

You follow the White Rabbit through the rabbit hole. Inside, its very tight and
dark. Suddenly, you fall down a hole you didn't see. While falling, you see many
strange objects such as a grandfather clock, mirrors, and beds. You cleverly use
your dress to parachute down and finally land in a room with checkered flooring.

You see the white rabbit go through a door, possibly leading to a new room. You
think you saw a table while the door was ajar, but you also hit your head while
falling.

You see a tiny door, through which you assume the rabbit went through. But you 
cannot believe your eyes, you think you just saw the doorknob on the door move!
You also see the table you previously saw and on it is an unknown potion.
