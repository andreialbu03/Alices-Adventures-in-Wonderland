Room with a table
Hello there! What are you doing here? Never mind that, why is everyone that passes by
here in such a rush! First that white rabbit and now you! I'm assuming you want to go

Imagination is the only weapon in the war with reality! We're all mad here. I'm mad.
You're mad. You might think I am crazy but I am not crazy; my reality is just different
from yours.

If you haven't seen them yet, the Mad Hatter and the March Hare are having a tea party!
Visit either you like: they're both mad.

Actually when I think about it, this is an unbirthday party!

Tea Party
Hello dear! Have some wine! You say you don't see any wine? That's because there is no
wine at the table! You see, we're having an unbirthday party! It's a very special day
for us, because it's the day we celebrate our unbirthday!
