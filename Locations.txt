You follow the White Rabbit through the rabbit hole. Inside, its very tight and
dark. Suddenly, you fall down a hole you didn't see. While falling, you see many
strange objects such as a grandfather clock, mirrors, and beds. You cleverly use
your dress to parachute down and finally land in a room with checkered flooring.

You see the white rabbit go through a door, possibly leading to a new room. You
think you saw a table while the door was ajar, but you also hit your head while
falling.
