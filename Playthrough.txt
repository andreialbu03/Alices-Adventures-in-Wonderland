Welcome to Alice's Adventures in Wonderland! This is a roleplaying
game based on the book by Lewis Carroll.  

The game is set in Wonderland, a strange and magical place where
anything can happen. You will be able to explore the world of 
Wonderland and meet many strange and wonderful characters. You will
also be able to interact with various items and objects in the game.

You will be playing Alice, a small and curious child in the Victorian
era. Your goal is to find your way through Wonderland to the Queen of
Hearts' palace. There, you will have to talk to her and take her staff
and necklace. Once you have done this, you will beat the game!

To play the game, type in a command and press enter.
You can type in commands in lower or upper case, it doesn't matter.
Many commands have synonyms, so you can type in a command in a
variety of ways. For example, you can type in "go north" or "go n".

Use the "examine" or "look" command to see what options are available to
you in a room. These can also be used on items.

You can type in "help" to get a list of all the commands.

You are sitting on a tree branch in an open field, listening to you sister

You follow the White Rabbit through the rabbit hole. Inside, its very tight and

your dress to parachute down and finally land in a room with checkered flooring.

You see the white rabbit go through a door, possibly leading to a new room. You
think you saw a table while the door was ajar, but you also hit your head while
falling.
